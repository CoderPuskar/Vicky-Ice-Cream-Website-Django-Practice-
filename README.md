Vicky Ice Cream Wala – A fun, practice project to build a website using Django. Created for learning and experimenting with Django, web development, and backend concepts in a hands-on way<br>





Vicky Ice Cream Wala is a fun and experimental project built to practice and enhance my skills in Django and web development.<br>


The goal of this project is not only to have fun building something creative but also to gain hands-on experience with Django’s backend features, templates, routing, and database integration. It’s a learning-focused project aimed at improving my understanding of web development concepts in a practical, enjoyable way.
